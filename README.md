## üìú Algorithms Implemented

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Global Alignment (Needleman-Wunsch)
**File:** `GlobalAlignment.py`

This script performs **global sequence alignment** using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which is widely used for aligning two full-length biological sequences.

#### üîπ Function: `GlobalAlignment(seq1, seq2, score)`
- **Parameters:**
  - `seq1` (str): The first sequence.
  - `seq2` (str): The second sequence.
  - `score` (tuple): Scoring system in the form `(match, mismatch, gap)`.
- **Returns:**
  - Tuple containing the score matrix and the aligned sequences `(aligned_seq1, aligned_seq2)`.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Local Alignment (Smith-Waterman)
**File:** `LocalAlignment.py`

This script performs **local sequence alignment** using the Smith-Waterman algorithm, which is useful for finding the most similar subsequences within two sequences.

#### üîπ Function: `LocalAlignment(seq1, seq2, score)`
- **Parameters:**
  - `seq1` (str): The first sequence.
  - `seq2` (str): The second sequence.
- **Returns:**
  - Tuple containing the aligned subsequences `(aligned_seq1, aligned_seq2)`.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ BLOSUM Matrix Calculation
**File:** `BLOSUM_calculation.py`

This script calculates the **BLOSUM substitution matrix** based on a given set of sequences, which is used for scoring alignments in sequence comparison.

#### üîπ Function: `BLOSUM_calculation(sequences)`
- **Parameters:**
  - `sequences` (list of str): A list of sequences to compute the BLOSUM matrix.
- **Returns:**
  - `numpy.array`: The computed BLOSUM matrix.
